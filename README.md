Description
------------

Note taker will allow the user to take notes and have them appear on the left hand side as a list. The notes will reset upon refresh of the page. The frontend portion of this application was given to me by the Trilogy coding bootcamp. The work performed is on the backend using Express and Node.js.

Features
------------------

The user has the capablity to take notes and have them saved to the list on the left side of the page upon clicking on the save icon in the top right. They are also capable of deleting notes by clicking on the red trash bin next to the specific note.

Lessons learned
---------------
There were significant difficulties in attempting to have the paths work properly when HTML routes and API routes were split into different files and then placed into a folder that is different than the server.js. The fix here was to put the entire routes into the server.js file and work from there alone.

I did not manage to get the application to delete specific notes and it ends up deleting every note instead. The fix was achieved by attaining assistance from a TA during my coding bootcamp and it involved comparing two of the proper variables together. Below is a code snippet of what should have been tracked instead of what I had prior.
```
var noteId = req.params.id;
    dataFile = JSON.parse(data);
if (parseInt(noteId) !== parseInt(dataFile[j].id))
```
